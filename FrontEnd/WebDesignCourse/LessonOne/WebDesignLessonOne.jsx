			"The internet is the common virtual space and platform where all of todays modern day communication unfolds.",
			"Under the hood it is really just a global network of interconnected computers that exchange data.",
			"Data exchange's typically follow certain procedures called standardized communication protocols.",
			"These communication protocols are important to ensure data security and assurances of intact delivery.",
			"An additional look deeper down would reveal that this data exchange occurs through real life physical infrastructure.",
			"Cables, routers, and satellites are essentially the true backbone of the internet, providing the mediums for which data exchange can occur.",
		],
		[
			"Whenever your browser wants to load a webpage, it creates a request and places it into something called a packet.",
			"It then sends out this packet for it to travel across networks of connected devices which use routing algorithms to direct each packet toward its final destination.",
			"Once the packet reaches its destination (the web server hosting the website), the server processes the request and either sends back the data requested, an error, or nothing at all.",
			"If the data sent back is quite large, we usually break it down into smaller chunks - called packets.",
			"Breaking data down into packets helps create a more efficient and reliable transmission of data",
			"Once your browser receives these packets, it reassembles them in the correct order and reconstructs the complete response.",
			"Your browser then reads over the data and renders the content into the webpage you see before you.",
		],
		[
			"As mentioned before the browser is responsible for requesting data, reassembling it, and displaying it.",
			"However the browser also does a whole lot more than just that.",
			"It also is responsible for running the javascript that powers websites, handling user interactions, managing local data, and ensuring security.",
			"As a little side note, the HTTP and HTTPS in the search panel you see often is actually the communication protocol all devices use to retrieve web pages and other associated resources.",
			"So any time you see HTTP or HTTPS, just think of it as 'This is just my device attempting to fetch a web resource.'",
